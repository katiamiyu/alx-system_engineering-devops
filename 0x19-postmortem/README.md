# Timeline

At 06:00 AM on March 3rd, 2024, our servers encountered a critical issue resulting in users encountering a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to our online store. This incident caused a disruption in the customer experience and potentially led to loss of sales for the period it lasted

Incident Details: At 06:00 AM on march 3rd, 2024, our monitoring system detected a surge in HTTP 500 errors originating from the company server. The issue affected a significant number of users attempting to complete transactions. The error consistently occurred when users clicked on the "add to chart" button after adding items to their cart.

# Root Cause

Preliminary investigation indicates that the problem originates from a misconfiguration in the server-side scripts responsible for managing purchase transactions. This misconfiguration led to an unhandled exception, resulting in the server returning a generic 500 Internal Server Error response.

# Resolution and Recovery

Immediate Actions Taken:

- Isolation of the Affected Server: The affected server was promptly isolated to mitigate further impact on the system.

- Rollback to Last Stable Configuration: To restore service functionality temporarily, a rollback to the last known stable configuration was initiated.

- Error Logging and Monitoring: Enhanced error logging and monitoring measures were implemented to capture detailed information about the errors and aid in identifying the root cause.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures

## Corrective Measures:

- Detailed Investigation: A thorough investigation will be conducted to pinpoint the specific misconfiguration and address the underlying issue.

- Implementation of Permanent Fix: Once the root cause is determined, a permanent solution will be implemented to prevent recurrence.

- Communication with Users: A communication plan will be devised to inform users about the incident, its resolution, and any necessary actions they may need to take.



## Preventive Measures:

- Regular Server Configuration Audits: Routine audits will be conducted to identify and rectify potential issues proactively.

- Enhanced Testing Protocols: Testing protocols will be strengthened to ensure that server-side scripts can handle various scenarios robustly.
